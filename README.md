# Wisdomloop MVP Monorepo

This is the Phase 1 MVP skeleton for a content automation platform for creators and agencies.

## Structure
- `/frontend` — Next.js (TypeScript) app: drag-and-drop UI, dashboard, analytics, brand onboarding, preview/tweak, mocked scheduling
- `/backend` — FastAPI (Python) app: endpoints for upload, transcription, chunking, asset generation, scheduling, analytics (all mocked for MVP)
- `/shared` — Shared types/interfaces (for future use)

## Getting Started

### Frontend
```
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### Backend
```
cd backend
# (Setup instructions will be added after backend scaffold)
```

## Product Principles
- Zero friction: drag, drop, connect content, everything else automated
- AI-first: all transformation, repurposing, and scheduling handled by models
- Scalable: single dashboard, multi-brand, white-label
- Data-driven: every output tracked, system learns and improves
